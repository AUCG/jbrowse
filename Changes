 * NON-BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE improvements to the JSON format used for
   track configuration, feature data, and image data
     - initial support for a new hook system for greater
       administrator-configurability of feature display
     - support for more than one level of subfeatures

 * Miscellaneous improvements and refactoring of data-formatting Perl
   code.

 * More detailed POD-based help documentation on all scripts

 * Nonfunctional --extraData switch remove from flatfile-to-json.pl

 * --tracklabel options to all scripts replaced with --trackLabel.

 * New suite of integration tests, and some unit tests, for
   server-side Perl code.

 * Beginnings of a suite of Selenium-based integration tests for the
   front-end JavaScript code.

 * Support for Apple touch-based devices merged into normal
   index.html, so that the same link can be used regardless of the
   browsing platform.

 * Bug fixed in which non-stranded features do not display properly
   (was a problem with the styles in the CSS).
