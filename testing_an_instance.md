## Testing a Web Apollo Instance

###Testing functions in the main window

1) Check display of tracks by "check" and "uncheck" clicks on list of evidence tracks. Display evidence available on other tracks. 

2) Drag and drop a gene onto the “User-created Annotations” (U-cA) area.

3) Test top-level menu options in the main window.
3.1) Test functions on each menu option:
-- Login: log in / out. 
-- File 
     / Open (Test that data can be loaded locally using URLs (File → Open → Remote URLs)).
     / Add Combination Track (see 10. below)
     / Add Sequence Search Track (perform search test)
-- Tools (see 3.2)
-- View: set and clear highlights, show plus / minus strands, resize quantitative tracks, color by CDS (also tested in 5.).

3.2) From “Tools” menu, query genome with BLAT using a sequence: 
E.g: Housekeeping gene Calpain small subunit 1 CPNS1, CAPNS1, CAPN4, CAPNS (UniProt).

3.3) Clear highlight using the command from the 'View' menu.

4) Search for an indexed gene (e.g. in honey bee demo CSN2_DANRE (it's on Group1.37:152689..155265)) by typing the gene name on the search box. 

5) Zoom in (double click) to inspect last exon (5'-3') of the displayed gene and:
-- change intron/exon boundary (dragging)
-- check the recalculated ORF
-- color by CDS

6) 'Zoom to base level' to reveal DNA Track and test sequence annotation alterations: 
-- Insertions 
-- Deletions 
-- Substitutions

7) 'Zoom back out', then reveal right-click menu. 

7.1) Test: 
-- Get Sequence
-- Delete, merge, split, duplicate, make intron, flip strand, set translation start, set translation end, longest ORF, readthrough. 
-- Undo/Redo
-- History
-- Annotation Info Editor: dbXRefs, Comments, GO IDs, PubMed IDs

7.2) Also, use annotation in progress + feature from an evidence track to test: 
set as 3' end, set as 5' end, set both ends.

8) Check that the URL can be used for sharing work (on a different browser): bring up different browser window and paste the shared URL. Check real-time update by dragging and dropping another exon to the model on the left (same strand); check that “non-canonical boundaries” warning sign appears as appropriate. Last, delete an exon, Redo/Undo to test. 

9) Test Export of User-created Annotations to Chado, GFF3, FASTA

10) Combination tracks: test that arithmetic combination of quantitative tracks is possible by combining tracks using the menu option: File → Add combination track

11) Test the “Reference Sequence Selection” screen. 
11.1) Select one scaffold / group and check that you are able to export GFF3 and FASTA from the File → Export menu option.
11.2) Check that you are able to query the entire genome using BLAT from this window using the Tools → Search sequence menu option.
