Building WebApollo
--------------------

To build WebApollo, we will first edit the configuration files, and *then* run a Makefile to create a WAR package.

### Before you build

You need to configure your instance using a config.properties and a
config.xml file, which are copied into the war file.

-   Copy the sample config / logging files to the right location.

    ```
    cp sample_config.properties config.properties
    cp sample_config.xml config.xml
    cp sample_log4j2.json log4j2.json
    cp sample_log4j2-test.json log4j2-test.json
    ```

-   Edit the config.properties file to point to the appropriate directories. A sample config might look like:

    ```
    jbrowse.data=/apollo/data
    datastore.directory=/apollo/annotations
    database.url=jdbc:postgresql:web_apollo_users
    database.username=postgres_user
    database.password=postgres_password
    organism=Pythium ultimum
    ```

**IMPORTANT: the jbrowse.data directory should not be placed
anywhere inside the Tomcat webapps folder, not even using
symlinks!! To avoid data loss when doing Tomcat Undeploy operations,
users are advised not to be touching anything inside of the webapps
folder.**

### Building the servlet

We use a Makefile to create our build package. The easiest method is to use the
download-release target to get the pre-compiled JBrowse+WebApollo package:

     make clean download-release package

This will compile a release package and produce the a WAR file in WEB_APOLLO_ROOT/target/apollo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war that is ready to deploy. See [deploying webapollo](Deploy.md) for the next steps for deploying.

Alternatively, developers or user's with custom builds are advised to review the [developer's guide](Developer.md) for further instructions on creating their own builds.
