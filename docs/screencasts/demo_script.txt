** set up browser to initial state **
** hit record **

I'm Rob Buels, lead developer of the JBrowse genome browser.  This short video gives an overview of the primary features of JBrowse.

Like most genome browsers, JBrowse lets you scroll back and forth through a genome, displaying data in multiple tracks on the screen.  For this demo, we are using a set of artificial test data.

Let's turn on some tracks by dragging them from the track list on the left into the main display pane -

** turn on Exonerate predictions, Simulated next-gen reads by dragging **

or by double-clicking them

** turn on volvox_microarray with double-click **

We can scroll back and forth a bit by clicking and dragging the mouse in the main pane.

** scroll with the mouse **

By double-clicking, you can zoom in, and shift-double-clicking zooms out.  You can also do these things using the buttons in the bar at the navigation area.

By typing in the location box in this area, you can jump to the locations of specific features, or to specific reference sequences.  Let's jump to test features number 14, called f14.  Notice that the track that contains f14 appeared when we jumped to it.

Another great way of navigating is what's called rubber-band zooming, or dynamic zooming, where you can highlight parts of the display that you want to zoom to.  You can do this both in the overview -

** highlight in the overview to zoom out **

and in the main view

One of the most exciting developments in JBrowse is the addition of the ability to display data directly from BAM and BigWig files, with no pre-processing necessary.  Just put your BigWig or BAM file on your web server, point JBrowse at it, and go.

# BAM alignments

First, let's have a look at some alignments from a BAM file, in the track labelled 'volvox-sorted.bam'.  We'll turn off these tracks to give us some space -

** turn off all visible tracks **

We'll drag it from the side bar to turn it on.

** turn on volvox-sorted.bam **

This is a simulated genomic resequencing dataset, with next-gen reads of 100bp, shown with a JBrowse Alignments track, which is optimized specifically for showing next-generation alignments.  As we scroll through, we can see that this data includes both sequencing errors and some SNPs.  It's easy to see visually where the reads agree on a sequence that is different from the reference, since it looks like a column of a different color.  To see all of the detailed information about a particular read, just click on it -

** click on one of the reads **

and a window showing all of the data for that read will come up.

** close the dialog **

Once again, all of this is being displayed directly from the BAM file itself.  As we scroll around, JBrowse is fetching small pieces of the file as they are needed, which works with even the largest BAM files.

# BigWig files

Similarly, JBrowse can also display quantitative data directly from BigWig files.  Let's turn off that alignment track, and turn on a couple of tracks that demonstrate the BigWig functionality -

** turn on BigWig Density and BigWig XY - volvox_microarray **

These are two different views of data from the same BigWig file, which contains some made-up quantitative test data.

The upper track, labeled 'BigWig Density' is a JBrowse Wiggle/Density track, set up to show the quantitative data as colored regions: blue for values above the data set's global mean, red for values below the mean.  More intense blues and reds indicate values that are further above or below the mean.

The lower track, labeled 'BigWig XY', is a JBrowse Wiggle/XYPlot track, which shows a bar graph of the quantitative data.  This one is configured to show the values as blue bars of varying heights, along with a yellow line showing the data's global mean, and grey shaded regions showing regions within one and two variances of the mean.

And, just as with the BAM track shown earlier, JBrowse fetches small parts of the BigWig file on an as-needed basis, so this works with even with very large BigWig files.

What's more, beginning in JBrowse 1.7, all of this data can be exported to a variety of file formats.  For example, to get the quantitative data for this particular region in a bedGraph file, I can just go to the menu for this track -

** click the track menu -> save track data **

choose to save the visible region, and bedGraph format

** choose visible region and bedGraph format **

and hit 'View'to see the bedGraph dump of the data in the currently visible region.

** hit View **

and there we have our bedGraph file with the data from this region.  If we want to save it to disk, we can hit the Save button here, or we could also have hit the save button on the previous screen.

This data-saving functionality works with all of the major data types supported by JBrowse, and can save files in FASTA, GFF3, BED, bedGraph, and Wiggle format.

** pull up the modencode demo in A NEW TAB **

Another exciting feature of JBrowse is the optional faceted track selector, which lets users efficiently find the tracks they want in JBrowse installations with hundreds or even thousands of tracks.http://biojava.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2012

Let's pull up another JBrowse demonstration that contains a snapshot of the modENCODE track metadata with 1,805 tracks.

With the faceted track selector, you can progressively narrow the set of tracks you're interested in by selecting the attributes you want them to have; that is, searching by one or more facets of the track data.  In the track selector, click to select an attribute, then click to select one or more values you want to search for.

So, let's say we want to find tracks with data from Robert Waterston's lab.  We go over to the 'Principal investigator' facet, and in there we see a list of PIs whose labs are generating these modENCODE tracks, with a count of how many tracks come from that lab.  OK, so we select Robert Waterston.

Now, say we also want only RNA-seq tracks, so we go to Technique and select RNA-seq.

** select Technique -> RNA-seq **

if we go back and look again at the principal investigators section, you can see that the PIs and counts have changed.  The list of values for each facet is affected by what is selected for the other facets, so now that we have selected RNA-seq, the Principal Investigators facet only shows PIs that have RNA-seq tracks, and it shows a count of how many RNA-seq tracks they have.

So now we have 89 matching tracks.  So, finally let's say we're only interested in tracks that involve C. elegans Dauer larvae, so we type 'dauer' in the text search box.  This narrows it to three tracks that satisfy the criteria: they are from Robert Waterston's lab, are produced with RNA-seq, and have the keyword 'dauer' in their metadata.

Now, let's say we change our mind and don't want to limit it just to RNA-seq tracks.  We can either click RNA-seq under Techniques again to toggle that selection off, or we could hit the red X next to technique to clear the selections for the whole facet.

Now we have 17 tracks that match: 3 RNA-seq tracks and 14 integrated-gene-model tracks, generated by the Waterston lab, and involving Dauer larvae.

To turn these on in the display, we either check the box next to each of them, or we can turn them all on and off at the same time using the check box in the column heading on the left.

And finally, if we want to clear our selections and start again, we can hit the 'Clear all filters' button, and find more tracks.

One last thing to point out: the faceted track selector also has a couple of special categories for tracks that are currently turned on, and tracks that have been recently used.  You can use these as search terms like anything else.  So if we want our recently used tracks for Dauer larvae, we can just select Recently Used, and type 'dauer' in the text box.

** turn off the faceted selector **

** Go back to the volvox data tab **
