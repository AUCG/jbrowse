I'm Rob Buels, lead developer of the JBrowse genome browser.  This short video gives an overview of the primary features of JBrowse.

Like most genome browsers, JBrowse lets you scroll back and forth through a genome, displaying data in multiple tracks on the screen.  For this demo, we are using a set of artificial test data.

Let's turn on some tracks by dragging them from the track list on the left into the main display pane.

** turn on Exonerate predictions, Simulated next-gen reads, volvox_microarray **

We can scroll back and forth a bit by clicking and dragging the mouse in the main pane.

** scroll with the mouse **

By double-clicking, you can zoom in, and shift-double-clicking zooms out.  You can also do these things using the buttons in the bar at the navigation area.

By typing in the location box in this area, you can jump to the locations of specific features, or to specific reference sequences.  Let's jump to test features number 14, called f14.  Notice that the track that contains f14 appeared when we jumped to it.

Another great way of navigating is what's called rubber-band zooming, or dynamic zooming, where you can highlight parts of the display that you want to zoom to.  You can do this both in the overview

and in the main view

One of the most exciting features of JBrowse is the optional faceted track selector, which lets users efficiently find the tracks they want in JBrowse installations with hundreds or even thousands of tracks.

Let's pull up another JBrowse demonstration that contains a snapshot of the modENCODE track metadata with 1,805 tracks.

With the faceted track selector, you can progressively narrow the set of tracks you're interested in by selecting the attributes you want them to have; that is, searching by one or more facets of the track data.  In the track selector, click to select an attribute, then click to select one or more values you want to search for.

So, let's say we want to find tracks with data from Robert Waterston's lab.  We go over to the 'Principal investigator' facet, and in there we see a list of PIs whose labs are generating these modENCODE tracks, with a count of how many tracks come from that lab.  OK, so we select Robert Waterston.

Now, say we also want only RNA-seq tracks, so we go to Technique and select RNA-seq.

** select Technique -> RNA-seq **

if we go back and look again at the principal investigators section, you can see that the PIs and counts have changed.  The list of values for each facet is affected by what is selected for the other facets, so now that we have selected RNA-seq, the Principal Investigators facet only shows PIs that have RNA-seq tracks, and it shows a count of how many RNA-seq tracks they have.

So now we have 89 matching tracks.  So, finally let's say we're only interested in tracks that involve C. elegans Dauer larvae, so we type 'dauer' in the text search box.  This narrows it to three tracks that satisfy the criteria: they are from Robert Waterston's lab, are produced with RNA-seq, and have the keyword 'dauer' in their metadata.

Now, let's say we change our mind and don't want to limit it just to RNA-seq tracks.  We can either click RNA-seq under Techniques again to toggle that selection off, or we could hit the red X next to technique to clear the selections for the whole facet.

Now we have 17 tracks that match: 3 RNA-seq tracks and 14 integrated-gene-model tracks, generated by the Waterston lab, and involving Dauer larvae.

To turn these on in the display, we either check the box next to each of them, or we can turn them all on and off at the same time using the check box in the column heading on the left.

And finally, if we want to clear our selections and start again, we can hit the 'Clear all filters' button, and find more tracks.

One last thing to point out: the faceted track selector also has a couple of special categories for tracks that are currently turned on, and tracks that have been recently used.  You can use these as search terms like anything else.  So if we want our recently used tracks for Dauer larvae, we can just select Recently Used, and type 'dauer' in the text box.

** turn off the faceted selector **

** Go back to the volvox data tab **
