Download Web Apollo
------------
 
<a href="https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/master/docs/Developer.md">On GitHub</a>

You can download the latest Web Apollo release from [github](https://github.com/gmod/Apollo.git) or from
[genomearchitect.org](http://genomearchitect.org) (the 1.x release branch is not available from genomearchitect yet).

We'll also use sample data from the Pythium ultimum genome as an example, provided as a
[separate download](http://icebox.lbl.gov/webapollo/data/pyu_data.tgz).
