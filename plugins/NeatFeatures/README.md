NeatFeatures is a JBrowse plugin.

It applies intron hats and a gradient 'tubular' look to features and subfeatures of HTMLFeatures tracks.
This is refactored from HTMLFeaturesEx.js implementation and the insertion/modification to DOM elements are done out-of-band.

What it does:
- draws intron hats and inverted hats for reverse direction features.
- it applies a gradient 'tubular' look to features and subfeatures, inheriting the feature colors and properties.
- modifies UTR to be a outlined box, inheriting the original color.
- generally functional in stand-alone JBrowse.
- special considerations have been made for the unique way Web Apollo renders it's subfeatures in nested way.


NOTE: This plugin requires an updated HTMLFeatures.js -- a small bug fixed (included as part of the first commit of NeatFeatures).
